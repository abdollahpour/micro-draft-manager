micro-draft-manager is a microservice that helps you to manage unstructured data in your application with sorting and full-text search.

For example, you have a blog system and you want to make users able to create a draft without triggering validations and check on saves and validate and publish the post when it's finished (when the user at some point taps on publish button). Your original service remains small, secure, and straightforward, micro-draft-manager manages all the heavy lifting for you.
